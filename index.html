                <ul><h2>
                    <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>

                    <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
                    <li>  A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project.</li>
                    <li>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window. It gained so much attention that they started a successful toy making company.</li>
